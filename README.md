# House-Price-Prediction
Classification project

This is academic machine learning project. In this project our objectives are to build a classification model for the Boston's houses prices. First part of the project are about domain understanding and explorator analysis. Then we have developed an quantitative analysis and it's important to clean the data. In the final part we built a different machine learning models and we have trained thes on our train data. With different metrics we evalueted the models to conclude our works. We have followed the Crisp-DM guidelines.
